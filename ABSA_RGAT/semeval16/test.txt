worst service i ever had
everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received .
our waiter was non - existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered , we were not given any water or utensils .
i complained to the manager , but he was not even apologetic .
fabulous italian food !

i have not a bad thing to say about this place .

mama mia – i live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place .
the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it 's edible , even when you order ahead .
best sushi in town .
the best calamari in seattle !
– ... and the best summertime deck experience -- they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the seattle evening weather .
a perfect place to take out of town guests any time of the year .
endless fun , awesome music , great staff ! ! !

the sushi here is delicious !
they have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from ; atlantic or pacific .

my only negative comment is that i wish the pieces were a little bigger .
the decor is rustic , traditional japanese .
the crowd is mixed yuppies , young and old .
the service was courteous and attentive .
mediocre food
the outside patio area has an abbreviated menu .
my g / f and i both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price .
we are locals , and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one - time customer tourists .

sunday afternoons there is a band playing and it is lots of fun .
seattle 's best winelist
– ray 's ( suprisingly ) has the city 's best & most diverse wine list .
the sommelier is fantastic , down - to - earth , & extremely knowlegable .
i would go back for the wine experience alone .
not the place it once was
– it is sad to see a place that was once " the " $ t$ to meet and eat for bfast or lunch , now be the $ t$ that is a big " dont bother . "
the food is not what it once was ( potions have seriously seen downsizing ) prices have gone up , and the service is the worst i have experienced anywhere ( including mainland europe ) .

what may be interesting to most is the worst sevice / attitude comes from the owners of this establishment .
this establishment really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of food televisions " diners , drive - ins , and dives " hosted by guy fieri , in which schooner or later was subject of .
perhaps now , scooner or later falls into the " dive " category .
i hope one day scooner or later returns to what it once was .

the regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive .

to be honest , i 've had better frozen pizza .
the only positive thing about mioposto is the nice location .

i was frankly shocked when i read the bad reviews - this place is fantastic ; it has not let us down in any way , and we 've eaten here more than 10 times .
the food is fantastic , and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we 've been there .

the only problem would be the wait , but we usually just have a drink in the front while $ t$ing .
seafood plus
the appetizer of oysters , lobster , crab ( small size ) made a perfect entre for my wife .
seabass on lobster risotto was the best .
caesar salad was superb .
great bottle of wine .
leave room for dessert .
the food was ok , but the service was so poor that the $ t$ was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served .

we had a very hard time getting the waitress ' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager .
as it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20 % discount on our bill .
avoid the place
when i got there i sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the service was horrible !

i waited for 10 - 15 minutes for service ordered a beer & was never served again .
i went home & looked them up online again where i discovered there is a link for a give away that does n't work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link .
after sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she 'd be right with us .
we left without ever getting service .
best crab cakes in town
– that s a big statement considering i 've been pulling crab traps and making the cakes myself since i was about seven - but something about these little devils gets better every time .
if you can , come to this place by boat and make it a whole evening .
great seasonal fish and seafood , with a classy waterfront setting .

best chinese food i have tasted in a long time
the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning .
the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese .
so about the prawns , they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter ... soooo good ... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty .

the brocollis were so fresh and tasty .

for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee ... oh la la yummy ! ! !
we are for sure coming back to this restaurant .
chintzy portions
– the sushi here is perfectly good , but for $ 5 a piece , either the slices of fish should be larger , or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant ( even for nyc ) .

terrible service , food ok , pricey

in other words , if they are n't making $ $ off of you then you do n't rate high on their ' service scale ' .
food wise , its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant is n't a fancy place .

as usual the omikase did n't disappoint in freshness , although it scored low on creativity and selection .
their specialty rolls are impressive , though i ca n't remember what we had .
great selection of sakes .
green tea creme brulee gets better each time i have it .
it is n't the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time .
very poor customer service .
– schooner or later 's charming location along the marina in long beach and average food does not , unfortunately , compensate for its very poor customer service .

while this diner had reasonably good food , the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence , and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service .

after one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress , a polite request that he not be bumped sent the $ t$ into an abusive rant .
a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment -- to say we had been " blown off " would be an understatement .
the manager continually interrupted with " is there anything else i can do for you ? " , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience .
you are with a hot date and he / she has an urge for sushi ... then this might be the place .
the fish was fresh , though it was cut very thin .
great service .
good sake selection .
dungeness crabs here !
– ray 's is the place to go for high quality seafood dinners .
we were only in seattle for one night and i 'm so glad we picked rays for dinner !
i love dungeness crabs and at ray 's you can get them served in about 6 different ways !
we shared the family platter and i especially enjoyed the black cod in sake kasu .
i ended the meal with the unusual dessert of a port and chocolate tasting .... yummy !
and the service was simply spendid - quite a delight .

in grammercy / union square / east village this is my neighbors and my favorite spot .
the music is great , no night better or worse , the bar tenders are generous with the pouring , and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits .

– i decided to eat at stack because of their price fixed pre - show dinner .
when i walked in , i was taken aback by their incredible wood decor .
the music playing was very hip , 20 - 30 something pop $ t$ , but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat , which became annoying midway through dinner .

i got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright .
it was n't the freshest seafood ever , but the taste and presentation was ok .
i picked the asparagus , which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared .
the 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great , at least initially .
the steak was done to my exact liking ( medium rare ) and was nice and juicy .
it?s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction , though both were indistinguishable in taste .

for the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower .

nothing on the menu is less than amazing .
go with some friends , wait the half hour or so with a cup of joe , and enjoy more than your average breakfast .
good eats .
i do n't know why anyone would want to write a great review about this place .
i have been to this place , folks and it is bad .
maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish that 's half - way decent .
i have been here , spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment .
fancy pieces of exotic fish on a $ 100 dollar plate and not one was eatable .

to the owners of open sesame ... bravo ... i ca n't wait to come back to dine at your restaurant !
it 's a tiny place so if you get there before 8 pm on a weekend ( thurs?sun ) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar .
everything , and i mean everything on the menu is delectable .
the waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa .
the sushi is as fresh as it comes?you'd think ocean was in their backyard , no joke !

big thick pepperoni
– the pepperoni 's cut real thick -- yum .
the pizza itself is not exactly the best i 've had ever , but still pretty good .
sit in the balcony

portions was just enough for me , but may not be for a big eater .

i have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd .
the bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink , the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser .

to start off , approximately 8 - 10 oz of orange juice will cost you $ 3 .
they serve it in a tall , skinny hour - glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .
i should have just asked for the check when i saw that ; but their menu was so unique that i continued .
the pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 8.50 for 3 - 6 " $ t$ ( one of them was more like 5 " ) in the pancake flight ( sample of 3 different $ t$ ) is well over - priced .
the pancakes should be larger ( at least 8 " ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .
on my meal i had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking , and would have had to send them back again if i had n't rejected the meal all together .

i rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and i was too frustrated to continue .
to their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was .
in the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small pancakes , a breakfast burrito , an orange juice and an iced tea ( i had water ) .

much more than just a great view !
– i am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at ray 's boathouse last friday completely exceeded my expectations .
ray 's is something of a seattle institution , but given its gorgeous sound views , i had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service .
imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third - best thing about ray 's !

to start things off , our lovely server brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order .
my party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the shilshole sampler ... a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns , smoked albacore tuna , ray 's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce .

for my entr&eacute;e , i completely enjoyed the seared alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard , artichoke hearts , fennel , and pecorino toscano .
the scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique ( not to mention tasty ) .
