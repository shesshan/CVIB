## 📜 Summary
> 🧐 Despite the effectiveness, deep ABSA models are susceptible to 🫧***spurious correlations***🫧 between input features and output labels, which in general suffer from poor robustness and generalization.

For better understanding, we provide an example of the spurious correlations problem in ABSA:

To address this challenge, we propose a novel **C**ontrastive **V**ariational **I**nformation **B**ottleneck framework (called **CVIB**), encompassing an original network and a self-pruned network. These two networks are optimized simultaneously via contrastive learning.
- We employ the variational information bottleneck (VIB) principle to learn an informative and compressed network (self-pruned network) from the original network, which discards the spurious correlations while preserving sufficient information about the sentiment labels.
- A self-pruning contrastive loss is devised to optimize these two networks, where the representations learned by two networks are regarded as a semantically similar positive pair while representations of two different instances within a mini-batch are treated as a negative pair. 

## 🧩 Architecture

## 🎯 Main Results

## 🗂 Code & Data

### Requirements
- Python 3.9.7
- PyTorch 1.11.0
- [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) 4.18.0
- CUDA 11.0

### Preparation
-  **BERT** <br>
Download the pytorch version [bert-base-uncased](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) from huggingface. Then, you can set the parameter `--bert_model_dir` to the local directory of the BERT model.

-  **Dependency Parser** <br>
Download [biaffine-dependency-parser-ptb-2020.04.06.tar.gz](https://storage.googleapis.com/allennlp-public-models/biaffine-dependency-parser-ptb-2020.04.06.tar.gz) to `./parser/` to build the dependency tree for review sentences. (necessary if you'd like to preprocess the data yourself.)

### Data Pre-process
Code for data preprocessing can be found in [data_preprocess_raw.py](/data_preprocess_raw.py) (for REST15, REST16) and [data_preprocess_xml.py](/data_preprocess_xml.py) (for REST14, LAP14, MAMS and [ARTS](https://github.com/zhijing-jin/ARTS_TestSet)). 

The preprocessed data can be found in [ABSA_RGAT/](/ABSA_RGAT/). Also, we have provided the preprocessed data for choosing ASGCN-BERT as the backbone in [ABSA_Graph/](/ABSA_Graph/).

### Training
Run the commands: ` bash train_xxx.sh `, e.g. run `bash train_res14.sh` to train with REST14 dataset.
