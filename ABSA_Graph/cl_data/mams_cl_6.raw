since the $T$ is not organized in the way to describe the size of each dish, and there is no omakase nor a course, waiter's recommendation may be crucial to decide what to order, but he just recommended what he likes without considering appropriate amount for one person, and even served shellfish to whom who had mentioned she is allergic to shellfish!

service was atrocious: $T$ came out 3 minutes after we ordered, and 10 minutes before we finally tracked down the bottle of wine we had ordered, the waiter rushed us from start to finish, we had to repeatedly track down someone to pour us more wine since it wasn't at the table, etc, etc.

i noticed many of the other comments had negative things to say about the service and $T$ - my thoughts and suggestions are: eat at the bar to avoid a rude waiter or bad service here and artisanal's reputation is based on the cheese, get the cheese and not the steak or whatever.

unfortunately it gets very crowded on the weekends, so if you don't mind $T$ at the bar you can skip the wait for a table.

the $T$ was quite bland, and the saag paneer was a huge disappointment--more like some kid's worst experience of creamed spinach with tofu-like cheese.

the downside is that perhaps due to $T$'s eclectic nature, the chef has trouble cooking any single type to perfection.

my friends and i dropped by on a sunday, and there was absolutely no $T$ (the supposed only female bartender even told us there was no one else but her, and given that there were people in there waiting to dine and drink, that was ridicoulas!

we loved the recommendation for the $T$, and i think the eggplant parmigiana appetizer should become an entree.

the $T$ sounded good but the grilled eggplant roll was oversauced with a pile of mint, pork chop was leathery, and everything just tasted wrong.

$T$ is coddling and correct and there's no sense of hurry, so diners linger over a cheese course or a round of liqueurs.
