fabulous decor - makes you feel like you 're in a trendy manhattan restaurant , very very good food , cheaply - priced , generally friendly staff , and if you 're a manhattanite , or spend most of your time in manhattan , [MASK] will make you feel at home ..... very soho / village / upper west side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele ..... all on roosevelt avenue !

only complaint is the pricing -- i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the [MASK] .

each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the [MASK] - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return .

as [MASK] does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !

there 's another [MASK] who i ca n't describe , she is about 5'6 " with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're * really * talking about .

the [MASK] came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it ) .
