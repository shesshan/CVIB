fabulous decor - makes you feel like you 're in a trendy manhattan restaurant , very very good food , cheaply - priced , generally friendly staff , and if you 're a manhattanite , or spend most of your time in manhattan , [MASK] will make you feel at home ..... very soho / village / upper west side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele ..... all on roosevelt avenue !

one would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby [MASK] would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .
